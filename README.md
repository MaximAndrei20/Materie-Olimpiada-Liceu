# High School Algorithms Collection

This repository contains a collection of algorithm implementations developed during high-school, for the National Olympiad of Informatics. Each file implements a different algorithm or problem type, in C++.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

| File | Algorithm / Problem | Short Description |
|---|---|---|
| `aint.cpp` | Interval Tree | Data structure for storing intervals and efficiently querying overlaps. |
| `aranjamente.cpp` | Arrangements / Permutations without repetition | Generates arrangements of elements â€” order matters, no repetition. |
| `cmlsc.cpp` | Longest Common Subsequence â€“ variant | Computes the longest common subsequence between sequences. |
| `combinari.cpp` | Combinations | Computes combinations (choose subsets) of elements, order doesnâ€™t matter. |
| `dijkstra.cpp` | Dijkstraâ€™s shortest path algorithm | Finds shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. |
| `kruskal.cpp` | Kruskalâ€™s minimum spanning tree | Builds a minimum spanning tree using union-find / sorting edges. |
| `permutari.cpp` | Permutations | Generate or count permutations (order matters). |
| `roy-warshall.cpp` | Roy-Warshall (Floyd-Warshall) | All-pairs shortest paths, or transitive closure in graphs. |
| `royfloyd.cpp` | Floydâ€™s algorithm variant | Another implementation or variant of Floydâ€™s algorithm (possibly for shortest paths). |
| `tarjan.cpp` | Tarjanâ€™s algorithm | Tarjanâ€™s algorithm for strongly connected components. |
